# language

When it comes to choosing a language to focus on, I am not a good example.
I have trouble staying with a programming language for my new projects and am often trying the same project in multiple languages
or sometimes even rewriting them in a language, switching to another, then going back.

There are a few languages that have a interactive, quality tutorials for free in my experience:
Those would be:
- JavaScript <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript>
- Python  <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python>
- Java  <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java>
- Ruby <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby>
- Go <https://tour.golang.org>
