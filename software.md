One thing that sucks about being new to development is that people are afaid to be opinionated:
  
Here is my opinion:

- Visual Studio 2017 is great but really slow unless you have a good computer.
- Sublime Text is good unless you like multitasking in one window(no terminal emulator built in)
- Visual Studio Code is great cuz it has a built in term but it's also written in Node and seems to be slow as a result
- Vim/Neovim and bash is pure bliss
- Atom is good but I personally find it underwhelming and slow for its ammount of features
- Emacs is not something I've ever dabbled in(maybe one day)

My conclusion:

Use whatever of these editors works well for you

My personal choice:

- If given Windows, I would use Sublime Text and cmd split equally on my screen
- If given a UNIX-like, I would 1000% use vim and bash, I also like BSD shells and others(tcsh, csh, etc, mksh) but my choice
  is always the GNU Bourne Again Shell
