One thing that sucks about being new to development is that people are afaid to be opinionated:
  
Here is my opinion:

- Visual Studio 2017 is great but really slow unless you have a good computer.
- Sublime Text is good unless you like multitasking in one window(no terminal emulator built in)
- Visual Studio Code is great cuz it has a built in term but it's also written in Node and seems to be slow as a result
- Vim/Neovim and bash is pure bliss
- Atom is good but I personally find it underwhelming and slow for its ammount of features
- Emacs is not something I've ever dabbled in(maybe one day)
- Intellij is also good, but your selection of supported languages is really poor, as they want more money from you for more
  language support, and it's not cheap. If you can use the Community Edition then by all means it will be a great experience(unless you     require a premium feature)
- gnome builder seems good but I have no experience with it.

My conclusion:

Use whatever of these editors works well for you

My personal choice:

- If given Windows, I would use Sublime Text and cmd split equally on my screen
- If given a UNIX-like, I would 1000% use vim and bash, I also like BSD shells and others(tcsh, csh, etc, mksh) but my choice
  is always the GNU Bourne Again Shell
